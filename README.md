## Download Datasetï¼š

### *Stock1*
The first dataset *Stock1*, with 503 stocks collected from the S\&P 500, composed of daily OHCLV (open, high, close, low, volume) data from 2012-01-04 to 2022-06-22. [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/)       
### *Stock2*
The second *Stock2*, composed of intra-day market hours OHCLV data from 2017-05-16 to 2017-12-06, for 467 stocks from    [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/daily-and-intraday-stock-price-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/daily-and-intraday-stock-price-data).  

 ### Volatility estimator

By Appling the classical volatility estimator, we can obtain the volatility time series of stock datasets. The volatility estimator is defined as: 

$V_t = \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^n (r_t)^2}$, where $r_t=\ln (c_t/c_{t-1})$ and $c_t$ is the closing price at time $t$.

## Run

run Syd_main.py on Synthetic dataset. 

run Stock1_main.py on Stock1 dataset. 

run Stock2_main.py on Stock2 dataset (real-time forecasting).
